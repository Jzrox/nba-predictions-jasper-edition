Using the Official NBA API this python model will predict the outcome of NBA games. You can use it with any combination of players, and it can predict the outcome of 3 player vs 3 player games, or 5 player vs 5 player games. You can enter the players yourself or you can randomize them. There are also presets for every current NBA team as of the 2023-24 NBA season. I created this because I love the NBA and thought that using the NBA API would be a fun starting point for learning data science.
